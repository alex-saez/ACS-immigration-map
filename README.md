# ACS-immigration-map
Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) published by the Census bureau, display top countries of origin for each US state in the form of an interactive map.

Need to download tables **ss14pusa.csv** and **ss14pusb.csv** [here](http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2014/1-Year/) and copy them to the 'data' directory.

See result [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/alex-saez/ACS-immigration-map/master/immigration_map.html).
